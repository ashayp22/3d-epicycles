# The 3D Etch A Sketch (with the Fourier Transform and Epicycles)

![](img/example.gif)

This is the code for https://3d-epicycles.ashayp.com/. 

I created this website because I wanted to extend the Fourier Transform + Epicycle examples I saw online to 3 Dimensions. Now, you can draw any 3D object using a bunch of rotating circles, from simple objects like cubes to complex objects like ice cream cones!

### Functionality

- Draw a variety of 3D objects, from simple cubes and cones to complex goldfish, ice cream cones, and dragons.
- Move around/zoom in the 3D space using your mouse and keyboard.
- A brief explanation on how the website was created using the Discrete Fourier Transform and Epicycles.

### Tools

- [three.js] (https://threejs.org/)
- [MathJax] (https://www.mathjax.org/)

### Sources

For those curious, these resources are good starting points in understanding the fourier transform and the drawing of epicycles.
