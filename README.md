# The 3D Etch A Sketch (with the Fourier Transform and Epicycles)

![](img/example.gif)

This is the code for https://3d-epicycles.ashayp.com/. 

I created this website because I wanted to extend the Fourier Transform + Epicycle examples I saw online to 3 Dimensions. Now, you can draw any 3D object using a bunch of rotating circles, from simple objects like cubes to complex objects like ice cream cones!

The site has the following functionality:

- Upload a .svg image and find its fourier epicycles.
- Draw in an image and find its fourier epicycles.
- A brief explanation of the mathematics connecting fourier series and revolving epicycles.

For those curious, these resources are good starting points in understanding the fourier transform and the drawing of epicycles.
